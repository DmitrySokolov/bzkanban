= Bz Kanban Board

== About

Visualize Bugzilla bugs as cards and columns with a Kanban inspired board.

== Requirements

 . Client: A modern web browser capable of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
 . Server: An existing Bugzilla 5.0+ server (because the board accesses bug data using the new Bugzilla REST API).

== Installation

 . Clone this git repo.
 . Configure which Bugzilla instance to connect to by modifying the hardcoded `bzSiteUrl` value in the `index.html` code.

== Usage

 . Open the `index.html` in your web brower.
 . Pick a product and milestone and view the board!

== FAQ

 . What do the colours on the cards represent?
  * The left hand side represents the bug priority (e.g. gold is p1)
  * The right hand side represents the bug severity (e.g. red is > normal, grey is < normal, green is an enhancement)
